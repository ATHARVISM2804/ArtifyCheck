# 🏥 Intelligent Radiology Assistant Machine (IRAM)

🚀 **AI-powered radiology assistant that provides instant and accurate disease detection from X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans, making healthcare faster, more accessible, and reliable.**

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Medical imaging is critical for diagnosing diseases such as pneumonia, lung cancer, and brain tumors. However, radiologists face major challenges:

- **High workload & fatigue**, leading to errors.  
- **Shortage of radiologists**, especially in rural areas.  
- **Slow diagnosis process**, delaying treatment.  
- **Human error in analysis**, affecting patient care.  

## 🎯 Solution
IRAM uses **Deep Learning & AI** to **automate** the detection of medical conditions in X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans. It provides **real-time diagnosis** and assists doctors in making faster, more accurate decisions.

## 🏗️ System Architecture
### 🔗 **How It Works**
1️⃣ **Image Input** → X-ray/MRI uploaded via camera or hospital database.  
2️⃣ **AI Model Processing** → Uses CNNs & Transformers to detect anomalies.  
3️⃣ **Diagnosis Report** → Displays results on a web-based dashboard for doctors.  

### 🖥️ **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend:** Flask/FastAPI, Python  
- **AI Model:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / Firebase  
- **Deployment:** AWS/GCP, Docker
